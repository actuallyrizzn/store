# Vendor User Walkthrough

This document covers all features accessible to vendors (users with store membership).

## Overview

**Important:** "Vendor" is not a user role in the database. A user becomes a vendor by having a row in the `store_users` table. A user with `role = 'customer'` who has store membership sees vendor features.

Vendors can do everything customers can, plus:
- Manage their store(s) settings
- Create, edit, and delete items
- View and manage deposits/withdrawals
- Process orders (mark shipped, release funds)
- View store-specific analytics

## Navigation Changes

When a user has store membership, additional nav items appear:
- **My store** - Link to their store page
- **Add item** - Create new item listing (links to API)
- **Deposits** - Manage vendor earnings/withdrawals

---
